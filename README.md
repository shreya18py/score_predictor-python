# score_predictor-python
This project is a beginner-friendly machine learning model built using Python.  
It takes a dataset, preprocesses it, trains a simple model, and makes predictions on unseen data.  

## Features
- Load and explore data using **Pandas**  
- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Train/test split for evaluation  
- Train a basic ML model (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Tree, etc.)  
- Evaluate performance with accuracy metrics  
- Make predictions on new input  

## Tech Stack
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn *(optional for visualization)*
